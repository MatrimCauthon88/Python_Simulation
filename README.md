# Python_Simulation

This is a simple python script that, given budget data, calculates the total number of months, the net total of profits/losses, the average of the changes in profit/losses, and the greatests increase and the greatest decrease including the date and amount for each. It also takes the final outcome of the script and outputs it to a CSV file.
